## site.pp ##

# This file (./manifests/site.pp) is the main entry point
# used when an agent connects to the server and asks for an updated configuration.
# https://docs.openvoxproject.org/openvox/latest/dirs_manifest.html
#
# Global objects like filebuckets and resource defaults should go in this file,
# as should the default node definition if you want to use it.

## Active Configurations ##

# Disable filebucket by default for all File resources. Server-side file
# backups add load and disk usage on the server and are rarely restored from;
# use version control and Hiera data to recover file content instead.
File { backup => false }

## Node Definitions ##

# The default node definition matches any node lacking a more specific node
# definition. If there are no other node definitions in this file, classes
# and resources declared in the default node definition will be included in
# every node's catalog.
#
# Note that node definitions in this file are merged with node data from
# External Node Classifiers (ENCs), if one is configured.
#
# For more on node definitions, see: https://docs.openvoxproject.org/openvox/latest/lang_node_definitions.html
node default {
  include role::agent
}

# The OpenVox Server: certificate authority, and codavox's publisher.
node 'puppet.example.com' {
  include role::primary
}

# Compilers, added with ovadm. Their certificates carry pp_role: openvox_compiler.
node /^compiler\d+\.example\.com$/ {
  include role::compiler
